## FACE RECOGNITION USING CS-NWALBP 
This paper is based on the implementation of facial recognition by using the feature extraction process CS-NWALBP(Center symmetric neighborhood weighted average local binary pattern). To further improve the performance of the existing local binary pattern (LBP) operator which is the first operator used to solve the complex illumination problem with facial recognition, neighborhood weighted average LBP (NWALBP) is first proposed for fully considering the strong correlations between pixel pairs in the neighborhood, which extends the traditional LBP uni-layer neighborhood template window to the bi-layer neighborhood template window and calculates the weighted average of bi-layer neighborhood pixels in each direction. Then, inspired by
center symmetric LBP (CS-LBP), center symmetric NWALBP (CS-NWALBP) is further proposed, which can effectively reduce computation complexity by only comparing the
weighted average values of the neighborhood pixels that are symmetric about the center pixel

## INSTALLATION
THE CODE IS WRITTEN IN MATLAB
## DOCUMENTATION
NWALBP is an improved LBP operator that is better for facial recognition under complex illuminations. For fully considering the strong correlations between pixel pairs in the neighborhood, the template window with a radius of 1 and size of 3*3 is extended to that with a radius of 2 and size of 5 by 5. Then, the weighted average values of the neighborhood pixels from the
inner and outer layers adjacent to the center pixel are calculated
